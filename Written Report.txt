Summary:
This analysis aimed to analyze further the performance of 15 different schools (from the Government and Independent) based on the Maths and Reading Scores. 

With the data given, and considering that scores above or equal to 50 mean the students had passed the courses. I could find different metrics,
such as: which was the average Maths and Reading scores by school. From those scores, what was the % of students that passed each course and which % 
passed both Maths and Reading.

Disregarding the school size, type, or budget - the analysis also allowed to sort the top-performing schools based on % of students that passed both courses
and which ones were the worst performing schools.

Finally, considering we had different school types, sizes and budgets per student, I created categories(bins) for each of these and grouped the schools under these.
This allowed to compare schools under similar conditions(same type, same size, etc) and see how they were performing and if any signficant trend popped up.

Conclusions:
1. The larger the size of the school - the worst the students' scores(Maths and Reading). The size_summary evidenced this.
2. Independent Schools had better performance/results in Maths and Reading than Government Schools. The type_summary evidenced this.
