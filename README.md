# pandas-challenge

The code for this task are located in the repo Laos27/pandas-challenge, inside the folder PyCitySchools.
In the main folder you will find the Written Report.txt.

Please take into account this code was run with the kernel: Anaconda 3 (Python3.9.13)

There is a warning when running the first part of the code: 
"C:\Users\61450\AppData\Local\Temp\ipykernel_29496\4039542485.py:27: FutureWarning: The frame.append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in a future version. Use pandas.concat instead."

However, considering the append method worked - I did not use the pandas.concat. Results were succesfully obtained and you can find them in the dataframe "area_summary".

The rest of the code run without any warnings.
